In certain\ninstances they would flank, or, like a bodyguard, quite surround some\nsuperior figure of their own class, moving along with them like\nAldebaran among the lesser lights of his constellation. That signal\nobject was the ‘Handsome Sailor’ of the less prosaic time alike of the\nmilitary and merchant navies. With no perceptible trace of the\nvainglorious about him, rather with the off-hand unaffectedness of\nnatural regality, he seemed to accept the spontaneous homage of his\nshipmates. A somewhat remarkable instance recurs to me. In Liverpool,\nnow half a century ago, I saw under the shadow of the great dingy\nstreet-wall of Prince’s Dock (an obstruction long since removed) a\ncommon sailor, so intensely black that he must needs have been a native\nAfrican of the unadulterate blood of Ham. A symmetric figure much above\nthe average height. The two ends of a gay silk handkerchief thrown loose\nabout the neck danced upon the displayed ebony of his chest; in his ears\nwere big hoops of gold, and a Scotch Highland bonnet with a tartan band\nset off his shapely head.",
        "input": "Before steamships were common, people walking along large seaport docks sometimes saw groups of tanned sailors, either naval or merchant, dressed for shore leave. Occasionally they would accompany and surround a particularly notable sailor from their group. This man, called the 'Handsome Sailor,' stood out among them without showing arrogance and accepted their respect naturally. About fifty years earlier in Liverpool, the narrator saw such a sailor near Prince’s Dock. He was very dark-skinned, likely a native African, tall and well-proportioned. He wore a loose silk handkerchief around his neck, gold hoop earrings, and a Scottish Highland bonnet with a tartan band."

At each spontaneous tribute rendered\nby the wayfarers to this black pagod of a fellow--the tribute of a pause\nand stare, and less frequent an exclamation--the motley retinue showed\nthat they took that sort of pride in the evoker of it which the Assyrian\npriests doubtless showed for their grand sculptured Bull when the\nfaithful prostrated themselves.

It\nwas black times, I tell you, aboard the _Rights_ here. I was worried to\nthat degree my pipe had no comfort for me. But Billy came; and it was\nlike a Catholic priest striking peace in an Irish shindy. Not that he\npreached to them or said or did anything in particular; but a virtue\nwent out of him, sugaring the sour ones. They took to him like hornets\nto treacle; all but the bluffer of the gang, the big, shaggy chap with\nthe fire-red whiskers.

So, in the second dog-watch one\nday the Red Whiskers, in presence of the others, under pretence of\nshowing Billy just whence a sirloin steak was cut--for the fellow had\nonce been a butcher--insultingly gave him a dig under the ribs.

Some\nof ’em do his washing, darn old trowsers for him; the carpenter is at\nodd times making a pretty little chest of drawers for him.

Not again very soon shall I, coming up from dinner, lean over\nthe capstan smoking a quiet pipe--no, not very soon again, I think. Ay,\nLieutenant, you are going to take away the jewel of ’em; you are going\nto take away my peacemaker.’ And with that the good soul had really some\nado in checking a rising sob.",

The rest of the crew liked Billy so much they did chores for him. Graveling said if Billy left, the crew’s harmony would be lost."

The mysteriousness here, became less\nmysterious through a matter of fact elicited when Billy at the capstan\nwas being formally mustered into the service.

Not noted by Billy as not coming within\nhis view was the involuntary smile, or rather grimace, that accompanied\nClaggart’s equivocal words.
