This is something I do to improve my mood and health. When I feel depressed, especially to the point where I have troubling thoughts, I see it as necessary to go to sea. This takes the place of more extreme actions. Like the philosopher Cato killing himself, I instead choose to board a ship.

Euroclydon, nevertheless,\nis a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the\nhob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind\ncalled Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the\nonly copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou\nlookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the\noutside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where\nthe frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only\nglazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my\nmind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are\nwindows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t\nstop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint\nhere and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The\nuniverse is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted\noff a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth\nagainst the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with\nhis shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a\ncorn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the\ntempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken\nwrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty\nnight; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their\noriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\nprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals.",
    "input": "The inn was an old house with a slanted roof and a leaning structure. It stood on a cold, windy corner, where the wind called Euroclydon blew strongly. This wind feels pleasant when one is inside by a warm fire. A writer once said that your experience of the wind depends on whether you are warm indoors or exposed to it from a broken window. I agreed with this idea and thought of my body as a house that could use some repairs. But it is too late to fix anything. Someone like the beggar Lazarus, lying outside in the cold, cannot escape the wind no matter how much he tries to block it. Meanwhile, someone like the rich man Dives, staying warm indoors, finds the weather beautiful and prefers making his own comfort with fire rather than relying on warm climates."
