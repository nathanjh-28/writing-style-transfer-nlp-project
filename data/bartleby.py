It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one\nof those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the\noriginal sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own\nastonished eyes saw of Bartleby, _that_ is all I know of him, except,\nindeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.",

    "target": "At the period just preceding the advent of Bartleby, I had two persons\nas copyists in my employment, and a promising lad as an office-boy.\nFirst, Turkey; second, Nippers; third, Ginger Nut. These may seem\nnames, the like of which are not usually found in the Directory. In\ntruth they were nicknames, mutually conferred upon each other by my\nthree clerks, and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or\ncharacters. Turkey was a short, pursy Englishman of about my own age,\nthat is, somewhere not far from sixty. In the morning, one might say,\nhis face was of a fine florid hue, but after twelve o’clock,\nmeridian—his dinner hour—it blazed like a grate full of Christmas\ncoals; and continued blazing—but, as it were, with a gradual wane—till\n6 o’clock, P.M. or thereabouts, after which I saw no more of the\nproprietor of the face, which gaining its meridian with the sun, seemed\nto set with it, to rise, culminate, and decline the following day, with\nthe like regularity and undiminished glory. There are many singular\ncoincidences I have known in the course of my life, not the least among\nwhich was the fact, that exactly when Turkey displayed his fullest\nbeams from his red and radiant countenance, just then, too, at that\ncritical moment, began the daily period when I considered his business\ncapacities as seriously disturbed for the remainder of the twenty-four\nhours. Not that he was absolutely idle, or averse to business then; far\nfrom it. The difficulty was, he was apt to be altogether too energetic.\nThere was a strange, inflamed, flurried, flighty recklessness of\nactivity about him. He would be incautious in dipping his pen into his\ninkstand. All his blots upon my documents, were dropped there after\ntwelve o’clock, meridian. Indeed, not only would he be reckless and\nsadly given to making blots in the afternoon, but some days he went\nfurther, and was rather noisy. At such times, too, his face flamed with\naugmented blazonry, as if cannel coal had been heaped on anthracite. He\nmade an unpleasant racket with his chair; spilled his sand-box; in\nmending his pens, impatiently split them all to pieces, and threw them\non the floor in a sudden passion; stood up and leaned over his table,\nboxing his papers about in a most indecorous manner, very sad to behold\nin an elderly man like him. Nevertheless, as he was in many ways a most\nvaluable person to me, and all the time before twelve o’clock,\nmeridian, was the quickest, steadiest creature too, accomplishing a\ngreat deal of work in a style not easy to be matched—for these reasons,\nI was willing to overlook his eccentricities, though indeed,\noccasionally, I remonstrated with him. I did this very gently, however,\nbecause, though the civilest, nay, the blandest and most reverential of\nmen in the morning, yet in the afternoon he was disposed, upon\nprovocation, to be slightly rash with his tongue, in fact, insolent.\nNow, valuing his morning services as I did, and resolved not to lose\nthem; yet, at the same time made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways\nafter twelve o’clock; and being a man of peace, unwilling by my\nadmonitions to call forth unseemly retorts from him; I took upon me,\none Saturday noon (he was always worse on Saturdays), to hint to him,\nvery kindly, that perhaps now that he was growing old, it might be well\nto abridge his labors; in short, he need not come to my chambers after\ntwelve o’clock, but, dinner over, had best go home to his lodgings and\nrest himself till teatime. But no; he insisted upon his afternoon\ndevotions. His countenance became intolerably fervid, as he\noratorically assured me—gesticulating with a long ruler at the other\nend of the room—that if his services in the morning were useful, how\nindispensable, then, in the afternoon?",
    "input": "Before Bartleby arrived, I employed two copyists and one office boy, called Turkey, Nippers, and Ginger Nut. These were nicknames. Turkey was a short, heavy Englishman about sixty years old. His face was normal in the morning but became red and heated after lunch, which also marked the time when his work became less reliable. He was still active but too energetic and careless, often making blots on documents and creating noise in the office. Despite this, he was very productive and skilled in the morning, so I tolerated his behavior. I suggested that he stop working after noon and rest instead, but he refused, insisting that his afternoon work was important."

    "target": "Nippers, the second on my list, was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the\nwhole, rather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty. I\nalways deemed him the victim of two evil powers—ambition and\nindigestion. The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the\nduties of a mere copyist, an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly\nprofessional affairs, such as the original drawing up of legal\ndocuments. The indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous\ntestiness and grinning irritability, causing the teeth to audibly grind\ntogether over mistakes committed in copying; unnecessary maledictions,\nhissed, rather than spoken, in the heat of business; and especially by\na continual discontent with the height of the table where he worked.\nThough of a very ingenious mechanical turn, Nippers could never get\nthis table to suit him. He put chips under it, blocks of various sorts,\nbits of pasteboard, and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite\nadjustment by final pieces of folded blotting paper. But no invention\nwould answer. If, for the sake of easing his back, he brought the table\nlid at a sharp angle well up towards his chin, and wrote there like a\nman using the steep roof of a Dutch house for his desk:—then he\ndeclared that it stopped the circulation in his arms. If now he lowered\nthe table to his waistbands, and stooped over it in writing, then there\nwas a sore aching in his back. In short, the truth of the matter was,\nNippers knew not what he wanted. Or, if he wanted any thing, it was to\nbe rid of a scrivener’s table altogether. Among the manifestations of\nhis diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from\ncertain ambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats, whom he called his\nclients. Indeed I was aware that not only was he, at times,\nconsiderable of a ward-politician, but he occasionally did a little\nbusiness at the Justices’ courts, and was not unknown on the steps of\nthe Tombs. I have good reason to believe, however, that one individual\nwho called upon him at my chambers, and who, with a grand air, he\ninsisted was his client, was no other than a dun, and the alleged\ntitle-deed, a bill. But with all his failings, and the annoyances he\ncaused me, Nippers, like his compatriot Turkey, was a very useful man\nto me; wrote a neat, swift hand; and, when he chose, was not deficient\nin a gentlemanly sort of deportment. Added to this, he always dressed\nin a gentlemanly sort of way; and so, incidentally, reflected credit\nupon my chambers. Whereas with respect to Turkey, I had much ado to\nkeep him from being a reproach to me. His clothes were apt to look oily\nand smell of eating-houses. He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy\nin summer. His coats were execrable; his hat not to be handled. But\nwhile the hat was a thing of indifference to me, inasmuch as his\nnatural civility and deference, as a dependent Englishman, always led\nhim to doff it the moment he entered the room, yet his coat was another\nmatter. Concerning his coats, I reasoned with him; but with no effect.\nThe truth was, I suppose, that a man of so small an income, could not\nafford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the\nsame time. As Nippers once observed, Turkey’s money went chiefly for\nred ink. One winter day I presented Turkey with a highly-respectable\nlooking coat of my own, a padded gray coat, of a most comfortable\nwarmth, and which buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck. I\nthought Turkey would appreciate the favor, and abate his rashness and\nobstreperousness of afternoons. But no. I verily believe that buttoning\nhimself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat had a pernicious effect\nupon him; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for\nhorses. In fact, precisely as a rash, restive horse is said to feel his\noats, so Turkey felt his coat. It made him insolent. He was a man whom\nprosperity harmed.",
    "input": "Nippers was about twenty-five, with a sallow complexion, whiskers, and an overall rough appearance. I believed his faults came from ambition and indigestion. His ambition showed in impatience with routine copying and his attempts to take on higher-level legal work. His indigestion appeared in irritability, grinding his teeth over copying mistakes, muttering curses, and constant dissatisfaction with the height of his work table, which he repeatedly tried to adjust with various materials but never to his liking. He sometimes met with questionable visitors he called clients, though at least one was actually a creditor. Despite these issues, he wrote quickly and neatly, dressed respectably, and reflected well on the office. In contrast, Turkey’s appearance was often messy, with oily clothes and a poor coat. I once gave Turkey a good, warm coat, hoping it would improve his behavior, but it made him more insolent."

    "target": "Now, the utterly unsurmised appearance of Bartleby, tenanting my\nlaw-chambers of a Sunday morning, with his cadaverously gentlemanly\n_nonchalance_, yet withal firm and self-possessed, had such a strange\neffect upon me, that incontinently I slunk away from my own door, and\ndid as desired. But not without sundry twinges of impotent rebellion\nagainst the mild effrontery of this unaccountable scrivener. Indeed, it\nwas his wonderful mildness chiefly, which not only disarmed me, but\nunmanned me, as it were. For I consider that one, for the time, is a\nsort of unmanned when he tranquilly permits his hired clerk to dictate\nto him, and order him away from his own premises. Furthermore, I was\nfull of uneasiness as to what Bartleby could possibly be doing in my\noffice in his shirt sleeves, and in an otherwise dismantled condition\nof a Sunday morning. Was any thing amiss going on? Nay, that was out of\nthe question. It was not to be thought of for a moment that Bartleby\nwas an immoral person. But what could he be doing there?—copying? Nay\nagain, whatever might be his eccentricities, Bartleby was an eminently\ndecorous person. He would be the last man to sit down to his desk in\nany state approaching to nudity. Besides, it was Sunday; and there was\nsomething about Bartleby that forbade the supposition that he would by\nany secular occupation violate the proprieties of the day.",
    "input": "I left as Bartleby asked, though I felt uneasy about being turned away from my own office. I doubted he was doing anything improper, but I wondered why he was there in casual clothes on a Sunday."

    "target": "Nevertheless, my mind was not pacified; and full of a restless\ncuriosity, at last I returned to the door. Without hindrance I inserted\nmy key, opened it, and entered. Bartleby was not to be seen. I looked\nround anxiously, peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that\nhe was gone. Upon more closely examining the place, I surmised that for\nan indefinite period Bartleby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my\noffice, and that too without plate, mirror, or bed. The cushioned seat\nof a rickety old sofa in one corner bore the faint impress of a lean,\nreclining form. Rolled away under his desk, I found a blanket; under\nthe empty grate, a blacking box and brush; on a chair, a tin basin,\nwith soap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper a few crumbs of\nginger-nuts and a morsel of cheese. Yes, thought I, it is evident\nenough that Bartleby has been making his home here, keeping bachelor’s\nhall all by himself. Immediately then the thought came sweeping across\nme, What miserable friendlessness and loneliness are here revealed! His\npoverty is great; but his solitude, how horrible! Think of it. Of a\nSunday, Wall-street is deserted as Petra; and every night of every day\nit is an emptiness. This building too, which of week-days hums with\nindustry and life, at nightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all\nthrough Sunday is forlorn. And here Bartleby makes his home; sole\nspectator of a solitude which he has seen all populous—a sort of\ninnocent and transformed Marius brooding among the ruins of Carthage!",
    "input": "I returned later and found Bartleby gone. Looking around, I realized he had been living in the office, with items like a blanket, washing supplies, and food remains. I thought about his extreme loneliness in the deserted building during nights and Sundays."

The bond of a common humanity now drew me\nirresistibly to gloom. A fraternal melancholy! For both I and Bartleby\nwere sons of Adam. I remembered the bright silks and sparkling faces I\nhad seen that day, in gala trim, swan-like sailing down the Mississippi\nof Broadway; and I contrasted them with the pallid copyist, and thought\nto myself, Ah, happiness courts the light, so we deem the world is gay;\nbut misery hides aloof, so we deem that misery there is none. These sad\nfancyings—chimeras, doubtless, of a sick and silly brain—led on to\nother and more special thoughts, concerning the eccentricities of\nBartleby. Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round me. The\nscrivener’s pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring\nstrangers, in its shivering winding sheet.",

I\nremembered that he never spoke but to answer; that though at intervals\nhe had considerable time to himself, yet I had never seen him\nreading—no, not even a newspaper; that for long periods he would stand\nlooking out, at his pale window behind the screen, upon the dead brick\nwall; I was quite sure he never visited any refectory or eating house;\nwhile his pale face clearly indicated that he never drank beer like\nTurkey, or tea and coffee even, like other men; that he never went any\nwhere in particular that I could learn; never went out for a walk,\nunless indeed that was the case at present; that he had declined\ntelling who he was, or whence he came, or whether he had any relatives\nin the world; that though so thin and pale, he never complained of ill\nhealth. And more than all, I remembered a certain unconscious air of\npallid—how shall I call it?—of pallid haughtiness, say, or rather an\naustere reserve about him, which had positively awed me into my tame\ncompliance with his eccentricities, when I had feared to ask him to do\nthe slightest incidental thing for me, even though I might know, from\nhis long-continued motionlessness, that behind his screen he must be\nstanding in one of those dead-wall reveries of his.",
    "input": "I thought about how Bartleby only spoke when answering, never read, often stared at the brick wall, never went out to eat or drink, avoided personal questions, and had a reserved manner that made me reluctant to ask him for small tasks."

My first emotions\nhad been those of pure melancholy and sincerest pity; but just in\nproportion as the forlornness of Bartleby grew and grew to my\nimagination, did that same melancholy merge into fear, that pity into\nrepulsion. So true it is, and so terrible too, that up to a certain\npoint the thought or sight of misery enlists our best affections; but,\nin certain special cases, beyond that point it does not. They err who\nwould assert that invariably this is owing to the inherent selfishness\nof the human heart. It rather proceeds from a certain hopelessness of\nremedying excessive and organic ill. To a sensitive being, pity is not\nseldom pain. And when at last it is perceived that such pity cannot\nlead to effectual succor, common sense bids the soul rid of it. What I\nsaw that morning persuaded me that the scrivener was the victim of\ninnate and incurable disorder.
