In\\ntruth they were nicknames, mutually conferred upon each other by my\\nthree clerks, and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or\\ncharacters. Turkey was a short, pursy Englishman of about my own age,\\nthat is, somewhere not far from sixty. In the morning, one might say,\\nhis face was of a fine florid hue, but after twelve o’clock,\\nmeridian—his dinner hour—it blazed like a grate full of Christmas\\ncoals; and continued blazing—but, as it were, with a gradual wane—till\\n6 o’clock, P.M. or thereabouts, after which I saw no more of the\\nproprietor of the face, which gaining its meridian with the sun, seemed\\nto set with it, to rise, culminate, and decline the following day, with\\nthe like regularity and undiminished glory. There are many singular\\ncoincidences I have known in the course of my life, not the least among\\nwhich was the fact, that exactly when Turkey displayed his fullest\\nbeams from his red and radiant countenance, just then, too, at that\\ncritical moment, began the daily period when I considered his business\\ncapacities as seriously disturbed for the remainder of the twenty-four\\nhours. Not that he was absolutely idle, or averse to business then; far\\nfrom it. The difficulty was, he was apt to be altogether too energetic.\\nThere was a strange, inflamed, flurried, flighty recklessness of\\nactivity about him. He would be incautious in dipping his pen into his\\ninkstand. All his blots upon my documents, were dropped there after\\ntwelve o’clock, meridian. Indeed, not only would he be reckless and\\nsadly given to making blots in the afternoon, but some days he went\\nfurther, and was rather noisy. At such times, too, his face flamed with\\naugmented blazonry, as if cannel coal had been heaped on anthracite. He\\nmade an unpleasant racket with his chair; spilled his sand-box; in\\nmending his pens, impatiently split them all to pieces, and threw them\\non the floor in a sudden passion; stood up and leaned over his table,\\nboxing his papers about in a most indecorous manner, very sad to behold\\nin an elderly man like him.

I did this very gently, however,\\nbecause, though the civilest, nay, the blandest and most reverential of\\nmen in the morning, yet in the afternoon he was disposed, upon\\nprovocation, to be slightly rash with his tongue, in fact, insolent.\\nNow, valuing his morning services as I did, and resolved not to lose\\nthem; yet, at the same time made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways\\nafter twelve o’clock; and being a man of peace, unwilling by my\\nadmonitions to call forth unseemly retorts from him; I took upon me,\\none Saturday noon (he was always worse on Saturdays), to hint to him,\\nvery kindly, that perhaps now that he was growing old, it might be well\\nto abridge his labors; in short, he need not come to my chambers after\\ntwelve o’clock, but, dinner over, had best go home to his lodgings and\\nrest himself till teatime. But no; he insisted upon his afternoon\\ndevotions.

        "    \"target\": \"Nippers, the second on my list, was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the\\nwhole, rather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty. I\\nalways deemed him the victim of two evil powers—ambition and\\nindigestion. The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the\\nduties of a mere copyist, an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly\\nprofessional affairs, such as the original drawing up of legal\\ndocuments. The indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous\\ntestiness and grinning irritability, causing the teeth to audibly grind\\ntogether over mistakes committed in copying; unnecessary maledictions,\\nhissed, rather than spoken, in the heat of business; and especially by\\na continual discontent with the height of the table where he worked.\\nThough of a very ingenious mechanical turn, Nippers could never get\\nthis table to suit him. He put chips under it, blocks of various sorts,\\nbits of pasteboard, and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite\\nadjustment by final pieces of folded blotting paper. But no invention\\nwould answer. If, for the sake of easing his back, he brought the table\\nlid at a sharp angle well up towards his chin, and wrote there like a\\nman using the steep roof of a Dutch house for his desk:—then he\\ndeclared that it stopped the circulation in his arms. If now he lowered\\nthe table to his waistbands, and stooped over it in writing, then there\\nwas a sore aching in his back. In short, the truth of the matter was,\\nNippers knew not what he wanted. Or, if he wanted any thing, it was to\\nbe rid of a scrivener’s table altogether. Among the manifestations of\\nhis diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from\\ncertain ambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats, whom he called his\\nclients. Indeed I was aware that not only was he, at times,\\nconsiderable of a ward-politician, but he occasionally did a little\\nbusiness at the Justices’ courts, and was not unknown on the steps of\\nthe Tombs. I have good reason to believe, however, that one individual\\nwho called upon him at my chambers, and who, with a grand air, he\\ninsisted was his client, was no other than a dun, and the alleged\\ntitle-deed, a bill. But with all his failings, and the annoyances he\\ncaused me, Nippers, like his compatriot Turkey, was a very useful man\\nto me; wrote a neat, swift hand; and, when he chose, was not deficient\\nin a gentlemanly sort of deportment. Added to this, he always dressed\\nin a gentlemanly sort of way; and so, incidentally, reflected credit\\nupon my chambers. Whereas with respect to Turkey, I had much ado to\\nkeep him from being a reproach to me. His clothes were apt to look oily\\nand smell of eating-houses. He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy\\nin summer. His coats were execrable; his hat not to be handled. But\\nwhile the hat was a thing of indifference to me, inasmuch as his\\nnatural civility and deference, as a dependent Englishman, always led\\nhim to doff it the moment he entered the room, yet his coat was another\\nmatter. Concerning his coats, I reasoned with him; but with no effect.\\nThe truth was, I suppose, that a man of so small an income, could not\\nafford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the\\nsame time. As Nippers once observed, Turkey’s money went chiefly for\\nred ink. One winter day I presented Turkey with a highly-respectable\\nlooking coat of my own, a padded gray coat, of a most comfortable\\nwarmth, and which buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck. I\\nthought Turkey would appreciate the favor, and abate his rashness and\\nobstreperousness of afternoons. But no. I verily believe that buttoning\\nhimself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat had a pernicious effect\\nupon him; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for\\nhorses. In fact, precisely as a rash, restive horse is said to feel his\\noats, so Turkey felt his coat. It made him insolent. He was a man whom\\nprosperity harmed.\",\n",

His ambition showed in impatience with routine copying and his attempts to take on higher-level legal work. His indigestion appeared in irritability, grinding his teeth over copying mistakes, muttering curses, and constant dissatisfaction with the height of his work table, which he repeatedly tried to adjust with various materials but never to his liking. He sometimes met with questionable visitors he called clients, though at least one was actually a creditor. Despite these issues, he wrote quickly and neatly, dressed respectably, and reflected well on the office. In contrast, Turkey’s appearance was often messy, with oily clothes and a poor coat. I once gave Turkey a good, warm coat, hoping it would improve his behavior, but it made him more insolent.\"\n",

So he sent him to my office as student at\\nlaw, errand boy, and cleaner and sweeper, at the rate of one dollar a\\nweek. He had a little desk to himself, but he did not use it much. Upon\\ninspection, the drawer exhibited a great array of the shells of various\\nsorts of nuts. Indeed, to this quick-witted youth the whole noble\\nscience of the law was contained in a nut-shell. Not the least among\\nthe employments of Ginger Nut, as well as one which he discharged with\\nthe most alacrity, was his duty as cake and apple purveyor for Turkey\\nand Nippers. Copying law papers being proverbially dry, husky sort of\\nbusiness, my two scriveners were fain to moisten their mouths very\\noften with Spitzenbergs to be had at the numerous stalls nigh the\\nCustom House and Post Office. Also, they sent Ginger Nut very\\nfrequently for that peculiar cake—small, flat, round, and very\\nspicy—after which he had been named by them. Of a cold morning when\\nbusiness was but dull, Turkey would gobble up scores of these cakes, as\\nif they were mere wafers—indeed they sell them at the rate of six or\\neight for a penny—the scrape of his pen blending with the crunching of\\nthe crisp particles in his mouth. Of all the fiery afternoon blunders\\nand flurried rashnesses of Turkey, was his once moistening a\\nginger-cake between his lips, and clapping it on to a mortgage for a\\nseal. I came within an ace of dismissing him then. But he mollified me\\nby making an oriental bow, and saying—“With submission, sir, it was\\ngenerous of me to find you in stationery on my own account.”\",\n",

Of a\\nSunday, Wall-street is deserted as Petra; and every night of every day\\nit is an emptiness. This building too, which of week-days hums with\\nindustry and life, at nightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all\\nthrough Sunday is forlorn. And here Bartleby makes his home; sole\\nspectator of a solitude which he has seen all populous—a sort of\\ninnocent and transformed Marius brooding among the ruins of Carthage!\",\n",

              " 'target': 'Nippers, the second on my list, was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the\\nwhole, rather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty. I\\nalways deemed him the victim of two evil powers—ambition and\\nindigestion. The ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the\\nduties of a mere copyist, an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly\\nprofessional affairs, such as the original drawing up of legal\\ndocuments. The indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous\\ntestiness and grinning irritability, causing the teeth to audibly grind\\ntogether over mistakes committed in copying; unnecessary maledictions,\\nhissed, rather than spoken, in the heat of business; and especially by\\na continual discontent with the height of the table where he worked.\\nThough of a very ingenious mechanical turn, Nippers could never get\\nthis table to suit him. He put chips under it, blocks of various sorts,\\nbits of pasteboard, and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite\\nadjustment by final pieces of folded blotting paper. But no invention\\nwould answer. If, for the sake of easing his back, he brought the table\\nlid at a sharp angle well up towards his chin, and wrote there like a\\nman using the steep roof of a Dutch house for his desk:—then he\\ndeclared that it stopped the circulation in his arms. If now he lowered\\nthe table to his waistbands, and stooped over it in writing, then there\\nwas a sore aching in his back. In short, the truth of the matter was,\\nNippers knew not what he wanted. Or, if he wanted any thing, it was to\\nbe rid of a scrivener’s table altogether. Among the manifestations of\\nhis diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from\\ncertain ambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats, whom he called his\\nclients. Indeed I was aware that not only was he, at times,\\nconsiderable of a ward-politician, but he occasionally did a little\\nbusiness at the Justices’ courts, and was not unknown on the steps of\\nthe Tombs. I have good reason to believe, however, that one individual\\nwho called upon him at my chambers, and who, with a grand air, he\\ninsisted was his client, was no other than a dun, and the alleged\\ntitle-deed, a bill. But with all his failings, and the annoyances he\\ncaused me, Nippers, like his compatriot Turkey, was a very useful man\\nto me; wrote a neat, swift hand; and, when he chose, was not deficient\\nin a gentlemanly sort of deportment. Added to this, he always dressed\\nin a gentlemanly sort of way; and so, incidentally, reflected credit\\nupon my chambers. Whereas with respect to Turkey, I had much ado to\\nkeep him from being a reproach to me. His clothes were apt to look oily\\nand smell of eating-houses. He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy\\nin summer. His coats were execrable; his hat not to be handled. But\\nwhile the hat was a thing of indifference to me, inasmuch as his\\nnatural civility and deference, as a dependent Englishman, always led\\nhim to doff it the moment he entered the room, yet his coat was another\\nmatter. Concerning his coats, I reasoned with him; but with no effect.\\nThe truth was, I suppose, that a man of so small an income, could not\\nafford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the\\nsame time. As Nippers once observed, Turkey’s money went chiefly for\\nred ink. One winter day I presented Turkey with a highly-respectable\\nlooking coat of my own, a padded gray coat, of a most comfortable\\nwarmth, and which buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck. I\\nthought Turkey would appreciate the favor, and abate his rashness and\\nobstreperousness of afternoons. But no. I verily believe that buttoning\\nhimself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat had a pernicious effect\\nupon him; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for\\nhorses. In fact, precisely as a rash, restive horse is said to feel his\\noats, so Turkey felt his coat. It made him insolent. He was a man whom\\nprosperity harmed.',\n",
              " 'input': 'Nippers was about twenty-five, with a sallow complexion, whiskers, and an overall rough appearance. I believed his faults came from ambition and indigestion. His ambition showed in impatience with routine copying and his attempts to take on higher-level legal work. His indigestion appeared in irritability, grinding his teeth over copying mistakes, muttering curses, and constant dissatisfaction with the height of his work table, which he repeatedly tried to adjust with various materials but never to his liking. He sometimes met with questionable visitors he called clients, though at least one was actually a creditor. Despite these issues, he wrote quickly and neatly, dressed respectably, and reflected well on the office. In contrast, Turkey’s appearance was often messy, with oily clothes and a poor coat. I once gave Turkey a good, warm coat, hoping it would improve his behavior, but it made him more insolent.'}"
