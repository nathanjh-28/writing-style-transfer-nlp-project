Test 5:
Input:     
When I say I go to sea when I feel physically or mentally
unwell, I do not mean I travel as a passenger. Passengers need money,
and they often get sick and uncomfortable. I also do not go as a high-
ranking officer or a cook. I avoid positions of responsibility and
prefer not to work hard or take on duties. While I respect good
cooking, I do not enjoy doing it myself. Ancient Egyptians preserved
animals they cooked, such as ibises and hippopotamuses, which were
later found as mummies.
Generated: 
It is true that people are hungry now but we must be careful 
lest some might eat our food; therefore you should try your best at home 
if possible (if no one else will). But there may be times where only someone 
who has been eating for days can afford anything more expensive than what he/she needs . 
This does have many benefits, especially during vacations like holidays with friends etc.

back and forth, went outside, and saw the moon had risen. He looked
into the room through the window and saw Siddhartha standing in the
same place with his arms folded and moonlight on his lower legs. The
father, feeling concerned, returned to bed.
Generated: "Siddaraja bhagavam" means a man who stands as if he were walking around at night; hence this is not just another name for someone like Kama Sankara or Gautami Ramachandra (who are also called sanyas). It's more akin than that which Mahabhasya was living under Babaji but before him there lived Brahma &

preparing to jump in. They do not stop near the buildings for shade.
They want to get as close to the water as they can without entering
it. Many people stand there, stretching for miles. They come from all
directions and different parts of the city. Yet they all gather at the
water. Is there something drawing them there, like a magnet attracts a
compass needle?

Test 1:
Input:     Manhattan is surrounded by docks, similar to how coral reefs
surround islands. Business activity covers it like waves. The streets
lead toward the water. At the southern tip is the Battery, where the
pier is hit by ocean waves and cooled by sea breezes that were far
from land not long ago. Many people are gathered there, watching the
water.

downhill to a pool of water. Even someone lost in thought will
unknowingly walk toward water if it is nearby. If you are ever thirsty
in a desert and traveling with a philosopher, try this as a method to
find water. Thought and water are closely connected.

times when he wishes for some fresh air or something else from
afar—even so far back as where there are no other human beings
anywhere near him, yet all that such feelings can accomplish; what
would have been done had they not happened? Would any man then wish

lamp there appeared from out some dark recess of another chamber
something like this—a small black door behind a desk which was closed
by heavy lockers that were left open; but all these locks could be
seen when they passed over the threshold. In front stood four men
holding their heads as if facing him towards the doorway. One held it
