Test 5:
Input:     
When I say I go to sea when I feel physically or mentally
unwell, I do not mean I travel as a passenger. Passengers need money,
and they often get sick and uncomfortable. I also do not go as a high-
ranking officer or a cook. I avoid positions of responsibility and
prefer not to work hard or take on duties. While I respect good
cooking, I do not enjoy doing it myself. Ancient Egyptians preserved
animals they cooked, such as ibises and hippopotamuses, which were
later found as mummies.
Generated: 
It is true that people are hungry now but we must be careful 
lest some might eat our food; therefore you should try your best at home 
if possible (if no one else will). But there may be times where only someone 
who has been eating for days can afford anything more expensive than what he/she needs . 
This does have many benefits, especially during vacations like holidays with friends etc.

Test 9:
Input:     After an hour without sleeping, the Brahman got up, walked
back and forth, went outside, and saw the moon had risen. He looked
into the room through the window and saw Siddhartha standing in the
same place with his arms folded and moonlight on his lower legs. The
father, feeling concerned, returned to bed.
Generated: "Siddaraja bhagavam" means a man who stands as if he were walking around at night; hence this is not just another name for someone like Kama Sankara or Gautami Ramachandra (who are also called sanyas). It's more akin than that which Mahabhasya was living under Babaji but before him there lived Brahma &

run traveled 417 feet to center field.
Generated: A homer by Jose Abreu will be listed as an extra base runner (in addition) after he is called out at third time and strike one count with runners advancing over second baseman Derek Jeter.

Test 2:
Input:     More people are walking straight toward the water, as if
preparing to jump in. They do not stop near the buildings for shade.
They want to get as close to the water as they can without entering
it. Many people stand there, stretching for miles. They come from all
directions and different parts of the city. Yet they all gather at the
water. Is there something drawing them there, like a magnet attracts a
compass needle?
Generated: The original was lost because I didn't have time or enough room on my phone screen when this one is finished!

Test 1:
Input:     Manhattan is surrounded by docks, similar to how coral reefs
surround islands. Business activity covers it like waves. The streets
lead toward the water. At the southern tip is the Battery, where the
pier is hit by ocean waves and cooled by sea breezes that were far
from land not long ago. Many people are gathered there, watching the
water.

Generated: Brooklyn's waterfronts have been a part-time business for decades now; however, they don't seem as much affected with today than when I wrote them last.

Test 3:
Input:     If you are in an area with lakes, most paths eventually lead
downhill to a pool of water. Even someone lost in thought will
unknowingly walk toward water if it is nearby. If you are ever thirsty
in a desert and traveling with a philosopher, try this as a method to
find water. Thought and water are closely connected.
Generated: " When I was on my last trip through Africa . There were some wild animals which would swim down from above me so that they could be eaten by birds or snakes who might eat them alive."
